To install requirements simply use: pip install general/requirements.txt

The files called Trainer are the ones to use to start trainings. 

Files ending with _env are the environments (see OpenAI gym) for our reinforcement learning application.

Here there are still no trained models, there will be some by the end of the project. Also a plot section will be added.
