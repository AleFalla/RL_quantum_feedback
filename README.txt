To install requirements simply use: pip install general/requirements.txt

The files called Trainer are the ones to use to start trainings. 

Files ending with _env are the environments (see OpenAI gym) for our reinforcement learning application.

Some training models are in the folder 'workingmodels' and most of them contain the whole training history

As the project is finalized a better readme section will be added.
